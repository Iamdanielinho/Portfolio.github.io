### Note
#### For My PowerBi Portfolio projects
##### When going through the Portfolio, clicking on the dashboard will take you to the PowerBi service where you can interact with my dashboard. This is possible only if you have a Microsoft powerBi service account. Otherwise, you can click on the project Topic or the View Project button to check out my Live analysis on LinkedIn.

##### Some dashboards have been updated and may not look the same when watching the Live analysis but you can check the interactive dashboard on PowerBi service.

##### Thanks
